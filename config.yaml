# AGATCGGAAGAGC

# Changed the Illumina small RNA sequence used for auto-detection to 'TGGAATTCTCGG' (from formerly 'ATGGAATTCTCG'). 
# The reason for this is that smallRNA libraries have ssRNA adapters ligated to their -OH end, a signature of dicer cleavage, so there is no A-tailing involved. Thanks to Q. Gouil for bringing this to our attention
